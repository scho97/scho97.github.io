					<h1>Convergent Cross Mapping Algorithm</h1>
				</header>
				
				<h2>Definition of Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM)</h2>
				<p>That correlation does not imply and is not a necessary and sufficient condition for causation is a well-established idea in science. Identifying causal relationships in time series is a challenging task, especially if the underlying complex systems are nonlinear and temporally lagged. Along with the Granger causality (GC) and phase slope index, one of the methods that can address such causality in complex systems is called convergent cross mapping (CCM).</p>
				<p>CCM is a statistical method for inferring causality based on nonlinear state space reconstruction [1]. Simply, consider two time-series variables \(X\) and \(Y\). In dynamical systems theory, if \(X\) and \(Y\) are from the same dynamic system, then these two time-series variables are causally related to one another and share a common attractor manifold \(M\) [1]. By characterizing correspondence between the shadow manifolds that are reconstructed from lagged coordinates of each time series, nonlinear interactions between time series \(X\) and \(Y\) can be defined [2]. That is, because the state of one variable can be identified (i.e. recovered) by that of another, CCM uses the estimate value of \(Y\) from the shadow manifold \(X\) and the estimate value of \(X\) from the shadow manifold \(Y\) to quantify the causal relationship between the two variables.</p>
				
				<h2>Takens' Theorem (1981)</h2>
				<p>Takens' theorem (or the delayed embedding theorem) states that the attractor manifold of a dynamical system can be reconstructed from a single observation variable. For example, given an observation function \(X(t)\) and its lagged-coordinate functions \(X(t-\tau), ..., X(t-n\tau)\) where \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), a shadow manifold \(M_X\) can be reconstructed based on those functions whereby the reconstructed manifold \(M_X\) preserves the essential mathematical properties (e.g. topology) of the common manifold \(M\).
				Hence, there is a bijection (i.e. 1:1 mapping) between the shadow manifold and the original manifold attractor. Given the time-series variables \(X\) and \(Y\), \(M_X\) and \(M_Y\) will 1:1 map to \(M\), and therefore \(M_X\) can be bijectively mapped to \(M_Y\). The definition of Takens' theorem can be found below.</p>

				<h4>Definition (adapted from [1])</h4>
				<p>Let \(M\) be a compact manifold of dimension \(d\), \(\Phi\) a smooth vector filed, and \(X\) a smooth function on \(M\). Then, it is a generic property that there exists an embedding $$\Phi_{\phi,X}(m):M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$$ where \(\phi\) is the flow on \(M\) and $$\Phi_{\phi,X}(m) = \langle X(m),X(\phi(m)),X(\phi^2(m)),...,X(\phi^{2d}(m)) \rangle$$</p>
				
				<h2>The Outline of Algorithm</h2>
				<p>The CCM algorithm can be simplified in a five step process. Written below are taken from [3], but you can further read about the algorithm on [2] or at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_cross_mapping">Wikipedia page</a>. </br>
				<blockquote>
					STEP 1: Create the shadow manifold for \(X\), namely \(M_X\) </br>
					STEP 2: Find the nearest neighbors to a point in the shadow manifold at time \(t\) </br>
					STEP 3: Create weights using the nearest neighbors </br>
					STEP 4: Estimate \(Y\) using the weights (the resulting cross-map estimate is denoted as \(\hat{Y_t}|M_X\)) </br>
					STEP 5: Compute the correlation \(\rho\) between \(Y\) and \(\hat{Y_t}|M_X\)
				</blockquote>

				<h2>CCM vs. Granger Causality</h2>
				<p>The variable \(X\) <i>Granger causes</i> \(Y\) if the predictability of \(Y\) decreases as \(X\) is removed from the set of all possible causative variables, \(U\) [1]. One of the major properties required for GC is separability of variables: each variable has an independently unique causative factor such that, for instance, the information about \(X\) is not contained in the time series \(Y\). Since purely stochastic and linear systems are separable, GC works best for such systems and is useful for detecting interactions between strongly synchronized variables in nonlinear systems [1]. However, such characteristic of GC provides for its own limitations. 
				It is less effective when it comes to deterministic dynamical systems with weak to moderate coupling and systems in which causal variables are non-separable (i.e. have synergistic effects) [1]. Unlike GC, CCM can be applied to detect variables with weak interactions and identify non-separable systems, as well as to distinguish interactions among observation variables (e.g. neuronal regions or ecological species) from the effects of shared, external driving variables.</p>

				<h2>Applications to Neuroscience</h2>
				<p>The application of CCM to neuroscience is rather uncommon. Given that neural signals are often, if not always, nonstationary and stochastic, I am also hesitant to implement CCM (which has been argued to be more effective for deterministic systems) to investigate interactions between neural components. Based on my search, there were a few literatures that have employed CCM for their data analysis. [4] used CCM method extended to delayed causal effects (cf. [5]) to evaluate causal relationship between local field potential and intrinsic optical signal in epileptiform activity. Interestingly, other papers that used CCM also studied epilepsy as their model. 
				In [2] and [6], CCM was applied on the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of EEG signals, which had their artifacts removed by independent component analysis (ICA) and were decomposed to IMFs via multivariate empirical mode decomposition. As of now, I am not completely sure if applying CCM to IMFs will provide more reliable analysis about the neuroscientific systems of our interest. Hopefully, I will be able to elaborate more on this part after looking at the Hilbert-Huang transform and other associated details.</p>
