								<p>I am a postgraduate research intern in <a href="https://www.jeelab.net/">Laboratory of Computational, Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience</a> at Korea Institute of Science and Technology. My current work focuses on 
								the question of how neural oscillations may be translated into animal behaviors and whether the oscillatory bursting phenomenon reliably represents emergence of transient functional 
								networks (i.e. long-range neural communications) when particular behaviors take place.
								Previously, I studied neuroscience and philosophy at the University of Chicago where I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=jzqLZ_wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Professor Wim van Drongelen</a>
								on nonlinear dynamical systems of focal epileptic seizures. Outside of neuroscience, I invested most of my times studying epistemology under the context of philosophy of logic, mathematics, and language.</p>

								</header>
								<p> My academic curiosity originates from epistemological concerns. Hence, inquiries I have about the nature include: (1) how we attain knowledge and reason, (2) how our knowledge can be conceptualized (e.g. visually) and communicated to another, (3) the biological structures of the truth (whether empirical or propositional) and justified belief, and (4) the mechanisms by which all these complexities can go astray.
								These questions, however, may appear too abstract and philosophical to many scientists. I believe neuroscience is the means to which I can formulate such questions scientifically tangible and answer them in a manner worthy of human understanding, by studying how brain processes and computes information from the external environment and builds complexities onto it.</p>
								<p>My primary research interests lie in <b>computational cognitive neuroscience</b>, within which I am braodly interested in the application of mathematical modeling, neuroimaging, dynamical studies, and machine learning for understanding higher cognitive abilities and their associated dysfunctions in human brain. Some of the questions I look forward to answer are specified below in two levels of study:</br></p>
								<h3>At systems level</h3>
								<p>At the systems level, I am interested in <b>the circuit architecture and the underlying computation</b> behind our cognitibe ability, as well as the dysfunctionality of the neural circuits inherent to <b>neuropsychiatric disorders</b>. 
								I do not have a particular cognitive ability or disorder that I would like to focus on at the current stage of my career, but I am rather captivated with the methodologies themselves. For instance, what are the biological and artificial neural networks that 
								can most accurately explain the dynamical neuronal states? How are information transmitted and processed within a single circuit or across multiscale networks? And finally, how are these structural and functional components reflected in the behaviors?</p>
								<h3>At cognitive level</h3>
								<p>At the cognitive level, I am mostly interested in <b>logical and mathematical thinking</b> and <b>decision making</b>. For the former theme, one of the fundamental problems we are yet to solve is the ways in which we learn basic arithmetic and logical properties (e.g. negation, conditionality).
								These properties are closely related to the question of how we come to conceive abstraction and how such abstraction is related to our sensory systems and consequent perception. Just like our natural language can bring forth memory and visual imagination, can similar phenomena occur for symbolic languages? 
								From this point of view, we can further question how cuasal inference, induction, abstract relations, pattern and rule recognition, and categorization are represented neurally. I am also interested in the decision making and the application of abstract thoughts to our decisions.
								If we understand logical thinking properly, would we be able to comprehend how moral and rational decisions are made and interact with human unrationality based on our current knowledge on perceptual and value-based decision studies?</p>
								<p>All of the questions above are in a general sense those that current neuroscientists are grappling with and major neuroscientific subcommunities are dedicated to. I am confident that my questions will gain more clarity and acuity as I continue on, and I hope to discover the neural mechanisms 
								behind our knowledge and reason in near future.</p>
